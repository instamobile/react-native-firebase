# Updated to ModularSDK
As it was outdated and used the Firebase namespace SDK I took the time and converted it to Firebase Modular SDK
# React Native Firebase

This is a React Native Firebase Starter Project with login, registration, persisted login, database reads and writes. You can use this project as boilerplate for bootstrapping any new React Native app that uses Firebase as its backend.

This React Native Firebase starter contains a few key features that all apps backed by Fireabase support:

* Registration with E-mail & Password
* Login with E-mail and Password
* Handling persisted login credentials
* Navigation (react-native-navigation)
* Writing to Firestore Database
* Reading from Firestore Database
* Creating Firestore indices (for performance)

## Getting Started (with Expo)

If you are using Expo Cli, clone the repo and run "expo start" in the root folder of the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/instamobile/react-native-firebase.git
cd react-native-firebase
npm install
expo start
```

## Getting Started (without Expo)

If you prefer using React Native CLI, you'll need to eject from Expo first:

```
git clone https://github.com/instamobile/react-native-firebase.git
cd react-native-firebase
expo eject
npm install
react-native run-android // react-native run-ios
```

This React Native Firebase starter is built with Firebase Web SDK, which makes it compatible with both Expo CLI and React Native CLI.
